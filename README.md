# Beverage Buddy App Starter for Vaadin
:coffee::tea::sake::baby_bottle::beer::cocktail::tropical_drink::wine_glass:

** NOTE: CONVERSION TO JOOQ ONGOING **. Please wait until the conversion has been finalized properly.

This is a [Vaadin-on-Kotlin](http://vaadinonkotlin.eu) example application,
used to demonstrate features of the Vaadin Flow Java framework.
A full-stack app: uses the H2 database instead of a dummy service. Requires Java 17+.

The Starter demonstrates the core Vaadin Flow concepts:
* [Building UIs in Kotlin](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-dsl) with components
  such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker`, `VerticalLayout` and `Grid` (see `CategoriesList`)
* [Creating forms with `Binder`](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-binder-in-review-editor-dialog.asciidoc) (`ReviewEditorDialog`)
* Making reusable Components on server side with `KComposite` (`AbstractEditorDialog`)
* [Creating Navigation with the Router API](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-annotation-based-router-api.asciidoc) (`MainLayout`, `ReviewsList`, `CategoriesList`)
* [Browserless testing](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing): see the
  [test suite package](src/test/kotlin/com/vaadin/starter/beveragebuddy/ui) for the complete test implementation.

This version of Beverage Buddy demoes the possibility of developing a Vaadin
web application purely server-side in the Kotlin language. There is no
JavaScript code in this project. If you'd like to see
a demo on how to create Polymer Templates, please head to the page of the
[original Beverage Buddy App](https://github.com/vaadin/beverage-starter-flow) (in Java).

See the [online demo](https://v-herd.eu/beverage-buddy-vok/).

# Documentation

Please see the [Vaadin Boot](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot#preparing-environment) documentation
on how you run, develop and package this Vaadin-Boot-based app.

## Database

Without the database, we could store the categories and reviews into session only, which would then be gone when the server rebooted.
We will use the [Vaadin-on-Kotlin](http://vaadinonkotlin.eu/)'s SQL database support. To make things easy we'll
use in-memory H2 database which will be gone when the server is rebooted - *touche* :-D

We will use [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) for database migration. Check out [Bootstrap.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/vaadin/starter/beveragebuddy/Bootstrap.kt)
on how the [migration scripts](src/main/resources/db/migration) are ran when the app is initialized.

The [Category](src/main/kotlin/com/vaadin/starter/beveragebuddy/backend/Category.kt)
and [Review](src/main/kotlin/com/vaadin/starter/beveragebuddy/backend/Review.kt)
entities are mapped to the database tables; inheriting from Entity and Dao
will make it inherit bunch of useful methods such as `findAll()` and `save()`. It will also gain means of
providing all of its instances via a `DataProvider`. See the [CategoriesList.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/vaadin/starter/beveragebuddy/ui/categories/CategoriesList.kt)
Grid configuration for details.
